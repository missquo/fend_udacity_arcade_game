## Introduction

This is a basic take on the Frogger arcade game from the 1980s.  The goal is the reach the water side of the board with your player without colliding with any enemy ladybugs.  Colliding with a ladybug will end the game resulting in a loss, and reaching the water will end the game resulting in a win.  It is Project #3 in [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Playing the Game

The player can play the game in any computer web browser by opening the index.html file.  The player initiates play by moving the player character using the up, down, left, and right arrows on the keyboard.  The game will end whenever the player makes it to the water side of the board, or collides with an enemy ladybug.
